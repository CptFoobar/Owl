                    <br> Thank you for choosing Owl.
                    <br> Owl is designed with one goal in mind, to make the online reading experience
                    <br> comfortable and less straining for the eyes.
                    <br>
                    <br> Here are some cool tips for making the most out of Owl:
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-push-1">
            <div class="panel panel-success" id="whats-new">
                <div class="panel-heading">
                    <h3 class="panel-title text-center">What's New!</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-body text-center" style="font-size: 0.825em;">
                    <ul class="text-left">
                        <li>
                            Customizable Hotkey shortcuts
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fixes in Classic theme
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="panel panel-primary">
                <div class="panel-heading">
                    <h3 class="panel-title text-center">Hotkeys</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-body text-center" style="font-size: 0.825em;">
                    You can now quickly toggle Owl between <em>ON</em> and <em>OFF</em> state using the hotkey combination
                    <strong>Shift + Alt + D</strong>. <br>
                    You can also quickly switch between the <em>Classic</em> and <em>Inversion</em> themes by using the
                    <strong>Shift + Alt + C</strong> hotkey combination.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="panel panel-primary">
                <div class="panel-heading">
                    <h3 class="panel-title text-center">Themes</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-body text-center" style="font-size: 0.825em;">
                    You can choose the type of theme that is applied to the pages when Owl is turned On.
                    <br> The choice is between the Classic theme (the theme which was used in v1.1.3 and older versions of Owl),
                    <br> or the new Inversion theme. This comes in handy when one of the two themes does not work as desired.
                    <br> In such cases, you can
                    <strong>switch between the two</strong> using the following steps:
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Open the Owl panel by clicking the Owl button in the toolbar.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Check the box that says 'Use Classic theme on this website'
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    This will cause the Classic theme to be loaded on all webpages in the current domain.
                    <br>
                    <br> In case you wish to use the Classic style as the default style for all websites, you can do so by
                    <br> going to the add-on's preference page (in about:addons), and
                    <strong>checking the 'Always use Classic theme'.</strong>


                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="panel panel-primary">
                <div class="panel-heading">
                    <h3 class="panel-title text-center">Whitelist</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-body text-center" style="font-size: 0.825em;">
                    You can make Owl stay disabled on certain websites, while still being ON on the other websites.
                    <br> This can be done by checking the
                    <strong>'Disable Owl for this website'</strong> option from the Owl panel,
                    <br> on the websites you don't want darkened.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="panel panel-primary">
                <div class="panel-heading">
                    <h3 class="panel-title text-center">Always Enable on specific websites</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-body text-center" style="font-size: 0.825em;">
                    You can also make Owl active on some specific website, even when it is turned OFF for other websites.<br  />
                    To do so, open the website you always want inverted, then:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Open the Owl Panel
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Turn ON the 'Always enable on this website' switch.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    Now this site will appear dark, even when Owl is OFF. <br>
                    You can always undo this from the panel or the Site Configuration Settings.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="panel panel-primary">
                <div class="panel-heading">
                    <h3 class="panel-title text-center">Theme for PDFs</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-body text-center" style="font-size: 0.825em;">
                    To make reading PDF files easier, Owl changes the color scheme <br/> of the PDF files (when viewing with Firefox) by default.
                    <br> If you wish to enable/disable inverting PDFs, head to the settings (from about:addons)
                    <br>and uncheck the <strong>'Invert PDFs'</strong> preference.
                </div>

                </div>
                <div class="panel-body text-center" style="font-size: 0.825em;">
                    You can easily manage theme settings for different websites by either of the two methods: <br />
                    1. Open the Owl panel and click the 'Configure Website Settings' button.
                    <br />or
                    <br />
                    2. Open add-on settings (about:addons), then click the 'Open Preferences' button. <br />
                    From there, you can choose which sites Owl should Classic theme on, <br/> and which sites are not to be inverted at all.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="panel panel-primary">
                <div class="panel-heading">
                    <h3 class="panel-title text-center">Owl on Startup</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-body text-center" style="font-size: 0.825em;">
                    You can also make Owl turn ON as soon as Firefox is started. To do this, simply go the add-on's
                    <br> preference page (by visiting about:addons) and checking the
                    <strong>'Enable Owl on startup'</strong> preference.
                    <br> This will start Owl on Firefox startup, so you never have to see those glaring website themes again.

            <div class="panel panel-primary">

                    For developers, it is often required to view files stored locally. To prevent Owl from inverting <br  />
                    these files, you can simply go to the add-on settings and uncheck the <strong>'Invert local files'</strong> option.
